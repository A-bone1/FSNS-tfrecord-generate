# FSNS-tfrecord-generate
FSNS tfrecord  generate

  Recently I would like to build a Chinese version based on Google Attention ocr and found that if you want to train your own model, you need to generate FSNS data format tfrecord, but Google officials did not say in this part carefully, only to a [stackoverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44461910/743658), but This link is also not clear, but also some mistakes, so I wrote a code to generate FSNS format (JPG / PNG) 
  The format of FSNS said in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.03970.pdf)
